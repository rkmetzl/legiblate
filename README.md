legiblate
=========

Really simple Sharepoint-RSS-description-field-to-hash gem

What's the purpose?
=========

I've been working with a lot of data feeds that are generated by Microsoft Sharepoint. Nokogiri works great for the actual XML, but I got tired of parsing the HTML in the <description> field by hand. This is my solution.

Neat! How do I install it?
=========

Simply add this repo to your gemfile:
`gem 'legiblate', :git => "git://github.com/rkmetzl/legiblate.git"`

run the good ol' `bundle install` and you should be golden.

Great, but how do I USE it?
========

If you're like me, you're probably using Nokogiri to parse the rest of the xml. That means you have some kind of feed object that's maybe called `billy` and you can access `billy`'s description via `billy.xpath('description').text`.

To generate the hash: `whatever = Legiblate.read(billy.xpath('description').text)`

now `whatever` contains said hash. That's all there is to it!

Copyright
========

There's no copyright. And honestly, if you're desperate enough to swipe someone else's code that consists of basically two well-thought regexes, you need all the help you can get, pal.
